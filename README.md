# MPHrandomizer

This is my attempt at making a randomizer for Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo DS.

Grab a fresh copy from the releases on the right!

# How to Use

You will need a program that can unpack and repack nds roms.

 1. Unpack a Metroid Prime Hunters Rev1 USA rom. I personally use **[dslazy](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/793/)**.  The addresses for these entity files might be the same across different MPH releases, but for now I'm sticking with Rev1 until I find out.
 2. Open up MPHrando and click "Browse for entities folder", then navigate to your unpacked rom. Select the "entities" folder in data\levels.
 3. Enter a seed value.
 4. Press randomize.
 5. Repack your MPH rom.
 And thats it!
 
 If you need help, I made a **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4i4qoCch90)** showing the instructions.

# Things to note

1. This is still very early in development, so there will be bugs.
2. The program will crash if you click randomize and then without closing the window click randomize again
3. Don't put non-number characters in the Seed entry box, that currently causes a crash.
4. It is in logic right now to do bomb jumps in the incubation vaults. This means that your second beam after Volt Driver could be placed in Incubation Vault 02 or 03.
5. I will eventually make the randomizer unpack and repack the rom on it's own.
7. If you boot to a red screen when using TwilightMenu on 3DS, repack the rom and try again.  I don't know why the 3DS doesn't like the rom sometimes.
