# MPHrandomizer
Official MPHrando Discord Server: **[MPHrandoServer](https://discord.gg/zECrj43DgU)**

This is my attempt at making a randomizer for Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo DS.

Grab a fresh copy from the releases on the right!

# How to Use

 1. Aquire the "Metroid Prime - Hunters (USA) (Rev 1).nds" rom of metroid prime hunters and place it in /rom. This will not work with any other version! (Note: The file needs to be named "Metroid Prime - Hunters (USA) (Rev 1).nds" for the randomizer to work.)
   
 2. Open MPHrando.

 3. Enter a seed value. (optional)

 4. Press randomize.
    
 5. The randomized rom will be in /rom. it's file name is the seed.
 
 And thats it!

# Things to note

1. This is still very early in development, so there will be bugs.
2. The program will crash if you click randomize and then without closing the window click randomize again
3. Don't put non-number characters in the Seed entry box, that currently causes a crash.
4. If you boot to a red screen when using TwilightMenu on 3DS, repack the rom and try again.  I don't know why the 3DS doesn't like the rom sometimes.

 
 # Special Thanks
 Special thanks to NoneGiven and unknown for their work on **[MPHread](https://github.com/NoneGiven/MphRead)** without that I wouldn't have been able to figure out how to change items.

 Special thanks to the developers of ndstool and the xdelta patcher. ndstool is used for unpacking and repacking the rom, the xdelta patcher is used for patching the game to have all planets open from the beginning.

# If you need help, or just wanna give me some feedback:
Feel free to join the Official **[MPHrandoServer](https://discord.gg/zECrj43DgU)** and shoot me a message!
I would love to hear about how you feel about item placement or ideas for features to be added

# Developing your own MPH randomizer:
Feel free to use code from this for your own MPH randomizer but if you do so please give me credit somewhere.
Also I won't be accepting any commits to this repository because this is a project that I'm having fun making on my own. Feel free to make a fork though.

# Enjoy!
