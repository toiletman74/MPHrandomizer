# MPHrandomizer
Official MPHrando Discord Server: **[MPHrandoServer](https://discord.gg/zECrj43DgU)**

This is my attempt at making a randomizer for Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo DS.

Grab a fresh copy from the releases on the right!

# How to Use

You will need a program that can unpack and repack nds roms.

 1. Download the **[deltapatcher](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/)**

 2. Download MPHallPlanetsOpenPatch.xdelta from above and then using the delta patcher, patch your Metroid Prime Hunters Rev1 USA rom.

 3. Unpack the rom. I personally use **[dslazy](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/793/)**.

 --Everything above this line only needs to be done one time! If you want a new seed you only need to do the steps below!--

 4. Open up MPHrando and click "Browse for entities folder", then navigate to your unpacked rom. Select the "entities" folder in data\levels.

 5. Enter a seed value.

 6. Press randomize.

 7. Repack your MPH rom. Using dslazy or whatever you use to unpack your roms.
 
 And thats it!

# Things to note

1. This is still very early in development, so there will be bugs.
2. The program will crash if you click randomize and then without closing the window click randomize again
3. Don't put non-number characters in the Seed entry box, that currently causes a crash.
4. If you boot to a red screen when using TwilightMenu on 3DS, repack the rom and try again.  I don't know why the 3DS doesn't like the rom sometimes.

 
 # Special Thanks
 Special thanks to NoneGiven and unknown for their work on **[MPHread](https://github.com/NoneGiven/MphRead)** without that I wouldn't have been able to figure out how to change items

# If you need help, or just wanna give me some feedback:
Feel free to join the Official **[MPHrandoServer](https://discord.gg/zECrj43DgU)** and shoot me a message!
I would love to hear about how you feel about item placement or ideas for features to be added

# Developing your own MPH randomizer:
Feel free to use code from this for your own MPH randomizer but if you do so please give me credit somewhere.
Also I won't be accepting any commits to this repository because this is a project that I'm having fun making on my own. Feel free to make a fork though.

# Enjoy!
